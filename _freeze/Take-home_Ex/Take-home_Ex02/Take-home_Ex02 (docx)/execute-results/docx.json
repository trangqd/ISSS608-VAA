Objective\n\nIn this exercise, I will tackle Question 2 from [Mini-Challenge 3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC3.html) of the [VAST Challenge 2025](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/index.html).\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #e3fcec; padding: 2em; border-radius: 12px\"}\n**Question 2**: Clepper has noticed that people often communicate with (or about) the same people or vessels, and that grouping them together may help with the investigation. Use visual analytics to help Clepper understand and explore the interactions and relationships between vessels and people in the knowledge graph. Are there groups that are more closely associated? If so, what are the topic areas that are predominant for each group?\n:::\n\n# 2. Data Overview\n\nThe dataset, MC3_graph.json, is a directed knowledge graph constructed from transcripts of boat radio communications. It aims to capture interactions between people, their roles, and the events and locations they discuss, ultimately supporting the prediction of when and where future events may occur.\n\nThe graph contains 1,159 nodes and 3,226 edges, and is stored in JSON format. Full description of node attributes and edge attributes is shown below.\n\n![](images/node_attributes.png)\n\n![](images/edges_attributes.png)\n\n# 3. Set up\n\n## 3.1.

Visual Analytics\n\n## 6.1. Relationship Analysis\n\nThis section focuses on exploring the relationships among involved individuals, organizations, and vessels.\n\n### 6.1.1. Person-to-Person Relationships\n\nTo explore social and operational connections among individuals in the Oceanus community, a network visualization is constructed to represent person-to-person relationships mediated by relationship-type nodes. The process involves the following steps:\n\n**Identifying Relationship Nodes**\n\nNodes labeled as \"Relationship\" are extracted from the cleaned graph data and split into two categories:\n\n-   Undirected relationships: Types like \"Friends\" and \"Colleagues\" which imply mutual connection.\n\n-   Directed relationships: All other types (e.g., \"Manager\", \"Employee\", \"Superior\"), which imply directional links.\n\n**Constructing Undirected and Directed Person–Person Edges**\n\n-   For undirected relationships, a table is built to capture all people connected to the same relationship node. These are paired using self-joins to create mutual (bidirectional) person-to-person links.\n\n-   For directed relationships, the graph schema supports a two-step link: a person connects to a relationship node, which then connects to another person.

Person-Vessel Relationships\n\nTo explore how individuals are connected to vessels, a tripartite network is constructed. The process began by identifying all relationship nodes and linking them to person nodes (Person → Relationship) and vessel nodes (Relationship → Vessel) using the edge table. These two-step connections are joined to form person–relationship–vessel triplets, capturing associations between people and vessels.\n\nAll involved nodes are extracted and categorized as Person, Relationship, or Vessel, with each assigned a unique row ID. These are used to build a node table (vis_nodes) with customized shapes and colors, and an edge table (vis_edges) to represent directional links.\n\nThe resulting network is visualized using the visNetwork package in R, where:\n\n-   Persons appear as orange dots,\n\n-   Relationships as sky-blue boxes,\n\n-   Vessels as green triangles.\n\n-   Interactive features allow for node highlighting and filtering, enabling intuitive exploration of how individuals may influence or interact with vessels via intermediary relationship types.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Construct person–relationship–vessel triplet\npr_edges <- edges_labeled %>%\n  filter(from_type == \"Person\", to %in% rel_ids) %>%\n  transmute(person_id = from,          \n            relationship_id = to)\n\nvessel_ids <- mc3_nodes_final %>%\n  filter(sub_type == \"Vessel\") %>% pull(new_index)\n\nrv_edges <- edges_labeled %>%\n  filter(from %in% rel_ids, to %in% vessel_ids) %>%\n  transmute(relationship_id = from,\n            vessel_id       = to)\n\ntriplets <- inner_join(pr_edges, rv_edges, by = \"relationship_id\")\n\nall_ids <- unique(c(triplets$person_id,\n                    triplets$relationship_id,\n                    triplets$vessel_id))\n\n# Node table\nrel_tbl <- mc3_nodes_final %>%\n  filter(new_index %in% all_ids) %>%\n  mutate(type = case_when(\n    new_index %in% vessel_ids ~ \"Vessel\",\n    new_index %in% rel_ids    ~ \"Relationship\",\n    TRUE                      ~ \"Person\"\n  )) %>%\n  select(index = new_index, label, type) %>%\n  distinct() %>%\n  arrange(index) %>%\n  mutate(row_id = row_number()) \n\nid_map <- rel_tbl %>% select(index, row_id)\n\n# Edge table\nedges_tbl <- bind_rows(\n  triplets %>%\n    select(from = person_id, to = relationship_id),\n  triplets %>%\n    select(from = relationship_id, to = vessel_id)\n) %>%\n  left_join(id_map, by = c(\"from\" = \"index\")) %>%\n  rename(.from = row_id) %>%\n  left_join(id_map, by = c(\"to\" = \"index\")) %>%\n  rename(.to = row_id) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(.from) & !is.na(.to)) %>%\n  transmute(from = .from, to = .to)\n\n# Visualize\nvis_nodes <- rel_tbl %>%\n  transmute(\n    id    = row_id,\n    label = label,\n    group = type,\n    shape = case_when(\n      type == \"Person\"      ~ \"dot\",\n      type == \"Relationship\"~ \"box\",\n      type == \"Vessel\"      ~ \"triangle\"\n    ),\n    color = case_when(\n      type == \"Person\"      ~ \"orange\",\n      type == \"Relationship\"~ \"skyblue\",\n      type == \"Vessel\"      ~ \"forestgreen\"\n    )\n  )\n\nvis_edges <- edges_tbl %>%\n  transmute(\n    from = from,\n    to   = to,\n    arrows = \"to\",\n    color  = \"gray\"\n  )\n\nnetwork2 <- visNetwork(vis_nodes, vis_edges) %>%\n  visNodes(font = list(size = 20)) %>%\n  visEdges(smooth = FALSE) %>%\n  visOptions(highlightNearest = list(enabled = TRUE, degree = 2, hover = TRUE), nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%\n  visLayout(randomSeed = 123) %>%\n  visLegend(addNodes = data.frame(\n    label = c(\"Person\", \"Relationship\", \"Vessel\"),\n    shape = c(\"dot\", \"box\", \"triangle\"),\n    color = c(\"orange\", \"skyblue\", \"forestgreen\")\n  ), useGroups = FALSE)\n\nimg2 <- render_visnetwork_as_image(network2, name = \"network2\")\nknitr::include_graphics(img2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/network2.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #fffbe7; padding: 2em; border-radius: 12px\"}\n**Insights**: The Person–Relationship–Vessel network visualization reveals a tightly interconnected operational structure centered around key individuals. Davis and Rodriguez emerge as central figures, each linked to multiple vessels through “Operates” and “Coordinates” relationships, suggesting they play pivotal roles in managing or overseeing maritime activities. Vessels such as Remora, Sentinel, Neptune, and Mako form the core of this network, with multiple people connected to each—indicative of shared usage and coordinated operations. While most links are operational, a few “Suspicious” relationships—such as those involving Defender and Knowles—highlight potential vessels of concern. Notably, individuals like Boss, Clepper Jensen, and Nadia Conti are connected to only one vessel or relationship, indicating they may be responsible for more high-level or strategic roles. Overall, the structure suggests a coordinated network with central command figures, key vessels, and isolated links that may warrant further investigation.\n:::\n\n## 6.2.

Person-Organization-Group Interactions\n\nThis analysis constructs a network to explore how people, organizations, and groups interact based on their co-occurrence in communication events.\n\nThe process begins by identifying all edges that connect an entity (either a Person, Organization, or Group) to a Communication event. Both directions are considered to capture all valid interactions.\n\nNext, for each communication event, all unique pairs of co-occurring entities are generated. The number of shared communication events between each pair is counted, forming a weighted edge list.\n\nEach unique entity is recorded as a node and labeled with its type (Person, Organization, or Group). A numeric ID is assigned to each node for graph construction. The entity pairs and node list are joined to create a graph-compatible edge table with numeric references.\n\nThe resulting network is visualized using ggraph, where:\n\n-   Edge width reflects the frequency of shared communications.\n\n-   Node color and shape represent entity type: orange circles for Persons, purple diamonds for Organizations, and brown squares for Groups.\n\n-   The Fruchterman–Reingold layout emphasizes structural proximity between frequently co-occurring entities.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Step 1: Get all Entity–Communication edges (Person, Organization, Group)\nentity_comm <- edges_labeled %>%\n  filter((from_type %in% c(\"Person\", \"Organization\", \"Group\") & to_type == \"Communication\") |\n         (from_type == \"Communication\" & to_type %in% c(\"Person\", \"Organization\", \"Group\"))) %>%\n  transmute(\n    entity     = if_else(from_type %in% c(\"Person\", \"Organization\", \"Group\"), from_name, to_name),\n    comm_id    = if_else(from_type == \"Communication\", from, to),\n    entity_type = if_else(from_type %in% c(\"Person\", \"Organization\", \"Group\"), from_type, to_type)\n  )\n\n# Step 2: Create all entity–entity pairs that co-occur in the same communication event\nentity_pairs <- entity_comm %>%\n  inner_join(entity_comm, by = \"comm_id\") %>%\n  filter(entity.x != entity.y) %>%\n  count(entity.x, entity.y, name = \"num_comm_events\") %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  mutate(p1 = min(entity.x, entity.y),\n         p2 = max(entity.x, entity.y)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  select(from = p1, to = p2, num_comm_events) %>%\n  distinct()\n\n# Step 3: Create node table with type info\nnode_types <- entity_comm %>%\n  select(name = entity, sub_type = entity_type) %>%\n  distinct()\n\nnetwork_nodes <- entity_comm %>%                 \n  distinct(name = entity, sub_type = entity_type) %>%\n  arrange(name) %>%                               \n  mutate(row_id = row_number())                   \n\nid_lkp <- network_nodes %>% select(name, row_id)\n\n# Step 4: Build edge table with numeric IDs\nnetwork_edges <- entity_pairs %>%\n  left_join(id_lkp %>% rename(from_id = row_id), by = c(\"from\" = \"name\")) %>%\n  left_join(id_lkp %>% rename(to_id = row_id),   by = c(\"to\"   = \"name\")) %>%\n  select(from = from_id, to = to_id, num_comm_events)\n\n# Step 5: Plot the network with ggraph\nset.seed(42)\nggraph(tbl_graph(nodes = network_nodes, edges = network_edges, directed = FALSE),\n       layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width = num_comm_events), alpha = 0.5, color = \"grey60\") +\n  geom_node_point(aes(color = sub_type, shape = sub_type), size = 4) +\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 3) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.3, 3)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    Person = \"orange\",\n    Organization = \"pink\",\n    Group = \"brown\"\n  )) +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(\n    Person = 19,\n    Organization = 18,\n    Group = 15\n  )) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"Person-Organization-Group Interactions\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex02--docx-_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #fffbe7; padding: 2em; border-radius: 12px\"}\n**Insights**: The network reveals a densely connected core of individuals and organizations, suggesting coordinated activity across multiple entities. V-Miesel Shipping appears central, linked to individuals such as Boss, Mrs. Money, Rodriguez, and The Middleman, indicating a potential hub for operational or logistical coordination. Oceanus City Council and Green Guardians also serve as prominent intermediaries, connecting civic actors like Samantha Blake, Liam Thorne, and The Lookout. Nadia Conti stands out as a central bridge across these clusters, linking both activist-aligned and logistics-aligned individuals.\n\nA notable observation is the presence of only one Group node — “City Officials” — which is completely disconnected from the rest of the network. This suggests that, although the entity exists in the data, it did not participate in any communication event involving the individuals or organizations present in this chart.\n:::\n\n### 6.2.3. Person-Organzation-Vessel Interactions\n\nIn this stage, an interactive network visualization is constructed to explore communication-based relationships among people, vessels, and organizations. The process begins with extracting communication links between each entity type and communication events. From these, co-occurrence pairs are formed—entities that appeared together in the same communication event—counted, and converted into a weighted edge list. A node table is created with entity names and types. Using tidygraph, a network graph object is built, and centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector) are computed to assess influence and positioning within the network. Finally, visNetwork is used to generate an interactive plot where node size reflects degree centrality, tooltip text displays all metrics, and nodes are colored and shaped based on their type (person, vessel, or organization). This allows for intuitive exploration of key actors and communication patterns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Build Communication tables\npc <- edges_labeled %>%\n  filter((from_type == \"Person\" & to_type == \"Communication\") |\n         (from_type == \"Communication\" & to_type == \"Person\")) %>%\n  transmute(entity = if_else(from_type == \"Person\", from_name, to_name),\n            comm   = if_else(from_type == \"Person\", to, from),\n            type   = \"Person\")\n\nvc <- edges_labeled %>%\n  filter((from_type == \"Vessel\" & to_type == \"Communication\") |\n         (from_type == \"Communication\" & to_type == \"Vessel\")) %>%\n  transmute(entity = if_else(from_type == \"Vessel\", from_name, to_name),\n            comm   = if_else(from_type == \"Vessel\", to, from),\n            type   = \"Vessel\")\n\noc <- edges_labeled %>%\n  filter((from_type == \"Organization\" & to_type == \"Communication\") |\n         (from_type == \"Communication\" & to_type == \"Organization\")) %>%\n  transmute(entity = if_else(from_type == \"Organization\", from_name, to_name),\n            comm   = if_else(from_type == \"Organization\", to, from),\n            type   = \"Organization\")\n\nentity_comm <- bind_rows(pc, vc, oc)\n\n# Pairwise co-occurrences\nedges_raw <- entity_comm %>%\n  inner_join(entity_comm, by = \"comm\", suffix = c(\"_a\", \"_b\")) %>%\n  filter(entity_a != entity_b) %>%\n  mutate(pair_id = map2_chr(entity_a, entity_b, ~ paste(sort(c(.x, .y)), collapse = \"||\"))) %>%\n  count(pair_id, entity_a, entity_b, name = \"weight\")\n\n# Node table\nnodes_tbl <- entity_comm %>%\n  distinct(name = entity, sub_type = type) %>%\n  mutate(row_id = row_number())\n\n# Edge table\nid_lkp <- nodes_tbl %>% select(name, row_id)\nedges_final <- edges_raw %>%\n  left_join(id_lkp, by = c(\"entity_a\" = \"name\")) %>% rename(from = row_id) %>%\n  left_join(id_lkp, by = c(\"entity_b\" = \"name\")) %>% rename(to = row_id) %>%\n  select(from, to, weight)\n\nfull_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes_tbl, edges = edges_final, directed = FALSE) %>%\n  mutate(\n    degree      = centrality_degree(),\n    betweenness = centrality_betweenness(),\n    closeness   = centrality_closeness(),\n    eigen       = centrality_eigen()\n  )\n\n# Visualize\nvis_nodes <- full_graph %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  mutate(\n    id = row_number(),\n    label = name,\n    value = scales::rescale(degree, to = c(5, 25)),  # Size by degree\n    group = sub_type,\n    color = case_when(\n      sub_type == \"Person\" ~ \"orange\",\n      sub_type == \"Vessel\" ~ \"forestgreen\",\n      sub_type == \"Organization\" ~ \"pink\",\n      TRUE ~ \"lightgray\"\n    ),\n    shape = case_when(\n      sub_type == \"Person\" ~ \"dot\",\n      sub_type == \"Vessel\" ~ \"triangle\",\n      sub_type == \"Organization\" ~ \"box\",\n      TRUE ~ \"ellipse\"\n    ),\n    title = paste0(\n      \"<b>\", name, \"</b><br>\",\n      \"Degree: \", degree, \"<br>\",\n      \"Betweenness: \", round(betweenness, 2), \"<br>\",\n      \"Closeness: \", round(closeness, 3), \"<br>\",\n      \"Eigenvector: \", round(eigen, 3)\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  select(id, label, group, shape, color, value, title)\n\nvis_edges <- edges_final %>%\n  mutate(arrows = \"none\", color = \"gray\") %>%\n  distinct()\n\nnetwork3 <- visNetwork(vis_nodes, vis_edges) %>%\n  visNodes(font = list(size = 16)) %>%\n  visEdges(smooth = FALSE) %>%\n  visOptions(\n    highlightNearest = list(enabled = TRUE, degree = 1, hover = TRUE),\n    nodesIdSelection = TRUE\n  ) %>%\n  visLayout(randomSeed = 42) %>%\n  visLegend(addNodes = data.frame(\n    label = c(\"Person\", \"Vessel\", \"Organization\"),\n    shape = c(\"dot\", \"triangle\", \"box\"),\n    color = c(\"orange\", \"forestgreen\", \"pink\")\n  ), useGroups = FALSE, position = \"right\")\n\nimg3 <- render_visnetwork_as_image(network3, name = \"network3\")\nknitr::include_graphics(img3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/network3.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #fffbe7; padding: 2em; border-radius: 12px\"}\n**Insights**: This network map illustrates the complex web of communication and co-occurrence among individuals, vessels, and organizations. At the center is a densely connected cluster revolving around vessels such as Mako, Remora, Reef Guardian, and Neptune, suggesting these are frequent topics of discussion.\n\nHighly connected individuals like Nadia Conti, Boss, Davis, and Mrs. Money, along with key organizations such as the Oceanus City Council and Green Guardians, play prominent roles—consistent with their high degree and betweenness centrality observed earlier. In contrast, individuals like Sam, Kelly, and The Lookout appear on the network’s periphery, linked to the core through only one or two connections, indicating more isolated or limited involvement.\n:::\n\n## 6.3. Clustering Analysis\n\nTo better understand the structure of interactions, I conducted two clustering analyses based on communication frequency. The first focused on Person–Organization communication, revealing how individuals cluster around formal entities they frequently communicate with. The second included Vessels to capture broader patterns, highlighting how people and organizations group around frequently discussed or engaged vessels. By comparing both, we can distinguish between clusters formed through institutional communication and those shaped by shared operational or topical focus.\n\n### 6.3.1. Person-Organization Clustering\n\nThis analysis aims to identify clusters of people and organizations that frequently co-occur in communication events. The process begins by filtering the edges to retain only those pairs that have interacted at least twice, ensuring meaningful connections. A graph is then constructed and restricted to its largest connected component to focus on the primary network structure. Centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, eigenvector) are computed to assess node influence. Louvain clustering is applied using edge weights (number of shared communication events) to detect densely connected communities. The resulting network is visualized with node size indicating degree centrality and color representing cluster membership.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Step 1: Filter edges with sufficient communication events\nnetwork_filtered <- network_edges %>%\n  filter(num_comm_events >= 2)\n\n# Step 2: Create graph\npp_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = network_nodes,\n                      edges = network_filtered,\n                      directed = FALSE) %>%\n  activate(edges) %>%\n  mutate(weight = num_comm_events)\n\n# Step 3: Filter to largest connected component\npp_graph <- pp_graph %>%\n  activate(nodes) %>%\n  filter(!node_is_isolated()) %>%\n  mutate(comp = group_components()) %>%\n  filter(comp == which.max(table(comp)))\n\n# Step 4: Compute centrality + clustering\npp_graph <- pp_graph %>%\n  activate(nodes) %>%\n  mutate(\n    cluster = as_factor(group_louvain(weights = weight)),\n    deg     = centrality_degree(),\n    betw    = centrality_betweenness(),\n    eig     = centrality_eigen()\n  )\n\n# Step 5: Plot with different shapes for Person vs Organization\nset.seed(1234)\nggraph(pp_graph, layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), colour = \"grey70\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = cluster, size = deg, shape = sub_type)) +\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = name, colour = cluster), repel = TRUE, size = 3) +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(\n    Person = 16,         # circle\n    Organization = 15    # square\n  )) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 2.5)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"People–Organization Clustering (Louvain method)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex02--docx-_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #fffbe7; padding: 2em; border-radius: 12px\"}\n**Insights**: The Louvain clustering reveals four distinct communities of people and organizations based on shared communication events:\n\n-   Cluster 1 (Red): Comprising Nadia Conti, Davis, Elise, and V.

In terms of centrality, The Intern, Mrs. Money, and Nadia Conti stand out as the most well-connected individuals, indicating their critical roles in the network's information flow.\n:::\n\n### 6.3.2. Person-Organization-Vessel Clustering\n\nThe second network graph is constructed to uncover clusters of people, organizations, and vessels that frequently co-occur in communication events. First, only strong connections—those with five or more shared communication events are retained to ensure meaningful interactions. A graph is then built and filtered to include only the largest connected component, focusing the analysis on the most relevant part of the network. Louvain clustering is applied using edge weights to detect community structures, while centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, eigenvector) are computed to identify influential entities. The resulting network is visualized with node size representing degree centrality and color indicating cluster membership, revealing key actors and tightly-knit groups in the communication ecosystem.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Step 1: Filter edges with sufficient communication events\nedges_filtered <- edges_final %>%\n  filter(weight >= 5)\n\n# Step 2: Create graph\nentity_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes_tbl,\n                          edges = edges_filtered,\n                          directed = FALSE) %>%\n  activate(edges) %>%\n  mutate(weight = weight)\n\n# Step 3: Filter to largest connected component\nentity_graph <- entity_graph %>%\n  activate(nodes) %>%\n  filter(!node_is_isolated()) %>%\n  mutate(comp = group_components()) %>%\n  filter(comp == which.max(table(comp)))\n\n# Step 4: Compute centrality + clustering\nentity_graph <- entity_graph %>%\n  activate(nodes) %>%\n  mutate(\n    cluster = as_factor(group_louvain(weights = weight)),\n    deg     = centrality_degree(),\n    betw    = centrality_betweenness(),\n    eig     = centrality_eigen()\n  )\n\n# Step 5: Plot with shape by sub_type\nset.seed(1234)\nggraph(entity_graph, layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), colour = \"grey70\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = cluster, size = deg, shape = sub_type)) +\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = name, colour = cluster), repel = TRUE, size = 3) +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(\n    Person = 16,         # circle\n    Organization = 15,   # square\n    Vessel = 17          # triangle\n  )) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 2.5)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(title = \"People–Organization–Vessel Clustering (Louvain method)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex02--docx-_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #fffbe7; padding: 2em; border-radius: 12px\"}\n**Insights**: The inclusion of vessels reveals distinct communication clusters centered around frequently mentioned ships and their associated entities.\n\n-   Cluster 1 (Red) is dominated by vessels like Mako, Remora, Neptune, and V.
